*Cell Selection for Testing Doorway functionality*
The Movie Theater has two doors which open RIGHT, the Game Room has a door that
opens UP, the Art Room has a door that opens DOWN and the Dining Room has a door 
that open LEFT. We chose a random walkway piece (4,6) to test to make sure that 
it does not identify as a doorway. We also chose a random room piece that was in 
room Sauna (19,21) to make sure that it does not identify as a doorway. We made 
sure to chose pieces from different rooms and part of the board to make sure that
all areas of the board were read in correctly with respect to doorway functionality.

*Cell Selection for Testing Correct Initials*
Cell (0,0) is a non-doorway cell in Movie Theater
Cell (8,23) is a walkway cell 
Cell (14,16) is a closet cell 
Cell (22,19) is a Kitchen cell
Cell (2,19) is a Observatory cell that is a doorway
We chose at least one cell that was a walkway, regular room object, doorway room object
and a closet object to make sure that all types of cells were tested for the correct initial.
