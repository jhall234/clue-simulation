For extra credit, we added functionality to display players separately if they are in the same room. 
This would occur if a player makes an accusation, thus moving the accused player in the same room. 
With our changes the players are drawn on different squares.

We dont know if this also counts, but all of the player's colors can be customized with
RBG values located in the CluePlayer.txt file. The colors used now more accurately portray 
the color-based names of the clue players.
